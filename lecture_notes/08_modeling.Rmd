## Nesting

### nest

The following example comes from [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/many-models.html) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham.

-   How can you run multiple models simultaneously? Using a nested data frame.

```

-   **Grouped data: each row = an observation**

-   **Nested data: each row = a group**

**Challenge**

Why did we use `country` and `continent` for nesting variables in the following example?

```{r}

nested <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(country, continent) %>%
  nest()

head(nested)

nested$data %>% pluck(1)
```

-   Custom function

```{r}
lm_model <- function(df) {
  lm(lifeExp ~ year, data = df)
}
```

-   Apply function to the nested data

```{r}
# Apply m_model to the nested data

nested <- nested %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, lm_model)) # Add the list object as a new column

head(nested)
```

S3 is part of R's object-oriented systems. If you need further information, check out [this section](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/S3.html) in Hadley's Advanced R.

### unnest

- glance() 

`glance()` function from `broom` package inspects the quality of a statistical model.

**Additional tips**

-   `broom::glance(model)`: for evaluating model quality and/or complexity
-   `broom::tidy(model)`: for extracting each coefficient in the model (the estimates + its variability)
-   `broom::augment(model, data)`: for getting extra values (residuals, and influence statistics). A convenient tool if you want to plot fitted values and raw data together. 

![Broom: Converting Statistical Models to Tidy Data Frames by David Robinson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VGPUBWGv6g&ab_channel=Work-Bench)

```{r}

glanced <- nested %>%
  mutate(glance = map(models, broom::glance))

# Pluck the first item on the list
glanced$glance %>% pluck(1)

# Pull p.value
glanced$glance %>%
  pluck(1) %>%
  pull(p.value)
```

`unnest()` unpacks the list objects stored in the `glanced` column

```{r}

glanced %>%
  unnest(glance) %>%
  arrange(r.squared)

glanced %>%
  unnest(glance) %>%
  ggplot(aes(continent, r.squared)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.5)
```

- tidy() 

```{r}
nested <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  nest()

nested <- nested %>%
  mutate(models = map(data, ~ lm(lifeExp ~ year + country, data = .)))

tidied <- nested %>%
  mutate(tidied = map(models, broom::tidy))

model_out <- tidied %>%
  unnest(tidied) %>%
  mutate(term = str_replace(term, "country", "")) %>%
  dplyr::select(continent, term, estimate, p.value) %>%
  mutate(p_threshold = ifelse(p.value < 0.05, 1, 0))

model_out %>%
  dplyr::filter(p_threshold == 1) %>%
  pull(term) %>%
  unique()
model_out %>%
  dplyr::filter(p_threshold == 0) %>%
  pull(term) %>%
  unique()
```

## Mapping

We tasted a bit of how `map()` function works. Let's dig into it more in-depth, as this family of functions is useful. See Rebecca Barter's excellent tutorial on the `purrr` package for more information. In her words, this is "the tidyverse's answer to apply functions for iteration". `map()` function can take a vector (of any type), a list, and a dataframe for input.

```{r}
multiply <- function(x) {
  x * x
}

df <- list(
  first_obs = rnorm(7, 1, sd = 1),
  second_obs = rnorm(7, 2, sd = 2)
) # normal distribution
```

**Challenge**

Try `map_df(.x = df, .f = multiply)` and tell me what's the difference between the output you got and what you saw earlier.

If you want to know more about the power and joy of functional programming in R (e.g., `purrr::map()`), then please take ["How to Automate Repeated Things in R"](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/R-functional-programming) workshop.

# Hypothesis testing 

Statistical inference: does the effect/difference in observed data occur by chance?

Null hypothesis: everything was random 
Alternative hypothesis: everything was not random. Note that this does not mean that a particular factor influenced the outcome of interest. Statistical inference != Causal inference (causes and effects)

$Y = X_{1} + X_{2} + X_{3} \epsilon$

[`infer`](https://github.com/tidymodels/infer) is for tidyverse-friendly statistical inference. 

**Workflow**

1. `specify()` specify a formula 
2. `hypothesize()` declare the null hypothesis 
3. `generate()` generate data based on the null hypothesis 
4. `calculate()` calculate a distribution of statistics from the generated data to form the null distribution 

![From infer package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidymodels/infer/master/figs/ht-diagram.png)

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(log_pop = log(pop))

ggplot(aes(x = log_pop, y = lifeExp), data = gapminder) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")

# Calculate the observed statistic: Observed slopes
observed_slopes <- gapminder %>%
  # specify(formula = lifeExp ~ log_pop) %>%
  specify(formula = lifeExp ~ log_pop) %>%
  calculate(stat = "slope")

# Generate the null distribution: Null slopes
null_slopes <- gapminder %>%
  # Specify a formula
  specify(formula = lifeExp ~ log_pop) %>%
  # Hypothesize (point estimation)
  hypothesize(null = "point", mu = 0) %>%
  # Generate sampling distributions (bootstrapping)
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  # Calculate statistics
  calculate(stat = "slope")

# Return data
null_slopes %>%
  # p-value is just the probability that observed pattern could arise if the null hypothesis was true
  # In social science convention, if alpha is below 0.005 (note: this is totally arbitrary), then the observed distribution is statistically significant.
  get_p_value(
    obs_stat = observed_slopes,
    direction = "both"
  )

# Visualize output
visualize(null_slopes) +
  shade_p_value(
    obs_stat = observed_slopes,
    direction = "both"
  )
```

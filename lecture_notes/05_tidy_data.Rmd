# Tidyverse

## The Big Picture

> "Tidy data sets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table." - Hadley Wickham

1.  Variables -\> **Columns**
2.  Observations -\> **Rows**
3.  Values -\> **Cells**

![Tidy Data Example (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-1.png)

If dataframes are tidy, it's easy to transform, visualize, model, and program them using tidyverse packages (a whole workflow).

![Tidyverse: an opinionated collection of R packages](https://miro.medium.com/max/960/0*mlPyX0NE0WQwEzpS.png)

-   Nevertheless, don't be **religious**.

> In summary, tidy data is a useful conceptual idea and is often the right way to go for general, small data sets, but may not be appropriate for all problems. - Jeff Leek

For instance, in many data science applications, linear algebra-based computations are essential (e.g., [Principal Component Analysis](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~kazdan/312S13/JJ/PCA-JJ.pdf)). These computations are optimized to work on matrices, not tidy data frames (for more information, read [Jeff Leek's blog post](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/17/non-tidy-data/)).

This is what tidy data looks like.

```{r}
if(!require(tidyverse)) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(tidyverse)

table1
```


**Additional tips** 

There are so many different ways of looking at data in R. Can you discuss the pros and cons of each approach? Which one do you prefer and why?


* `str(table1)`

* `glimpse(table1)`: similar to `str()` cleaner output 

* `skim(table1)`: `str()` + `summary()` + more 


- The big picture 
    - Tidying data with **tidyr**
    - Processing data with **dplyr**
    
These two packages don't do anything new but simplify most common tasks in data manipulation. Plus, they are fast, consistent, and more readable.

Practically, this approach is right because you will have consistency in data format across all the projects you're working on. Also, tidy data works well with key packages (e.g., `dplyr,` `ggplot2`) in R.

Computationally, this approach is useful for vectorized programming because "different variables from the same observation are always paired". Vectorized means a function applies to a vector that treats each element individually (=operations working in parallel).

# Tidying (tidyr)

## Reshaping

**Signs of messy datasets**

* 1. Column headers are values, not variable names.
* 2. Multiple variables are not stored in one column.
* 3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.
* 4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.
* 5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

Let's take a look at the cases of untidy data.

![Messy Data Case 1 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-5.png)

-   Make It Longer

    | Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |
    |------|------|------|
    |      |      |      |
    |      |      |      |
    |      |      |      |

**Challenge**: Why is this data not tidy?

```{r}
table4a
```

-   Let's pivot (rotate by 90 degrees).

![Concept map for pivoting. By Florian Schmoll, Monica Alonso.](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/raw/master/en/pivoting.svg)

-   [`pivot_longer()`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) increases the number of rows (longer) and decreases the number of columns. The inverse function is `pivot_wider()`. These functions improve the usability of `gather()` and `spread()`.

![What pivot\_longer() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-longer-image.png)

![Concept map for pipe operator. By Jeroen Janssens, Monica Alonso.](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/09/concept-maps/pipe-operator.png)

- The pipe operator `%>%` originally comes from the `magrittr` package. The idea behind the pipe operator is [similar to](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial) what we learned about chaining functions in high school. f: B -> C and g: A -> B can be expressed as $f(g(x))$. The pipe operator chains operations. When reading the pipe operator, read as "and then" (Wickham's recommendation). The keyboard shortcut is ctrl + shift + M. The key idea here is not creating temporary variables and focusing on verbs (functions). We'll learn more about this functional programming paradigm later on.

```{r}
table4a

# Old way, less intuitive
table4a %>%
  gather(
    key = "year", # Current column names
    value = "cases", # The values matched to cases
    c("1999", "2000")
  ) # Selected columns
```

```{r}
# New way, more intuitive
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Selected columns
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases"
  ) # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
```

-   There's another problem, did you catch it?

-   The data type of `year` variable should be `numeric` not `character`. By default, `pivot_longer()` transforms uninformative columns to character.

-   You can fix this problem by using `names_transform` argument.

```{r}
table4a %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("1999", "2000"), # Put two columns together
    names_to = "year", # Shorter columns (the columns going to be in one column called year)
    values_to = "cases", # Longer rows (the values are going to be in a separate column called named cases)
    names_transform = list(year = readr::parse_number)
  ) # Transform the variable
```

**Additional tips**

`parse_number()` also keeps only numeric information in a variable.

```{r}
parse_number("reply1994")
```

A flat file (e.g., CSV) is a rectangular shaped combination of strings. [Parsing](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readr/vignettes/readr.html) determines the type of each column and turns into a vector of a more specific type. Tidyverse has `parse_` functions (from `readr` package) that are flexible and fast (e.g., `parse_integer()`, `parse_double()`, `parse_logical()`, `parse_datetime()`, `parse_date()`, `parse_time()`, `parse_factor()`, etc).

-   Let's do another practice.

**Challenge**

1.  Why is this data not tidy? (This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).) Too long or too wide?

```{r}
billboard
```

2.  How can you fix it? Which pivot?

```{r}
# Old way
billboard %>%
  gather(
    key = "week",
    value = "rank",
    starts_with("wk")
  ) %>% # Use regular expressions
  drop_na() # Drop NAs
```

-   Note that `pivot_longer()` is more versatile than `gather()`.

```{r}
# New way
billboard %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = starts_with("wk"), # Use regular expressions
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "rank",
    values_drop_na = TRUE # Drop NAs
  )
```

-   Make It Wider

-   Why is this data not tidy?

```{r}
table2
```

-   Each observation is spread across two rows.

-   How can you fix it?: `pivot_wider()`.

**Two differences between `pivot_longer()` and `pivot_wider()`**

-   In `pivot_longer()`, the arguments are named `names_to` and `values_to` (*to*).

-   In `pivot_wider()`, this pattern is opposite. The arguments are named `names_from` and `values_from` (*from*).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_longer()` is 3 (col, names\_to, values\_to).

-   The number of required arguments for `pivot_wider()` is 2 (names\_from, values\_from).

![What pivot\_wider() does (Source: <https://www.storybench.org>)](https://www.storybench.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/pivot-wider-image.png)

```{r}
# Old way
table2 %>%
  spread(
    key = type,
    value = count
  )
```

```{r}
# New way
table2 %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = type, # first
    values_from = count # second
  )
```

Sometimes, a consultee came to me and asked: "I don't have missing values in my original dataframe. Then R said that I had missing values after doing some data transformations. What happened?"

Here's an answer.

R defines missing values in two ways.

-   *Implicit missing values*: simply not present in the data.

-   *Explicit missing values*: flagged with NA

**Challenge**

The example comes from [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html).

```{r}
stocks <- tibble(
  year = c(2019, 2019, 2019, 2020, 2020, 2020),
  qtr = c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4),
  return = c(1, 2, 3, NA, 2, 3)
)

stocks
```

-   Where is the explicit missing value?

-   Does `stocks` have implicit missing values?

```{r}
# implicit missing values become explicit
stocks %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = year,
    values_from = return
  )
```

**Challenge**

-   This exercise comes from [`pivot` function vigenette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html).

-   Could you make `station` a series of dummy variables using `pivot_wider()`?

```{r}
fish_encounters
```

1.  Which pivot should you use?

2.  Are there explicit missing values?

3.  How could you turn these NAs into 0s? Check `values_fill` argument in the `pivot_wider()` function.

-   Separate

![Messy Data Case 2 (Source: R for Data Science)](https://garrettgman.github.io/images/tidy-6.png)

```{r}
# Toy example
df <- data.frame(x = c(NA, "Dad.apple", "Mom.orange", "Daughter.banana"))

df
```

```{r}
# Separate
df %>%
  separate(x, into = c("Name", "Preferred_fruit"))

# Don't need the first variable

df %>%
  separate(x, into = c(NA, "Preferred_fruit"))
```

**Practice**

```{r}
table3
```

-   Note `sep` argument. You can specify how to separate joined values.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
    into = c("cases", "population"),
    sep = "/"
  )
```

-   Note `convert` argument. You can specify whether automatically convert the new values or not.

```{r}
table3 %>%
  separate(rate,
    into = c("cases", "population"),
    sep = "/",
    convert = TRUE
  ) # cases and population become integers
```

-   Unite

`pivot_longer()` \<-\> `pivot_wider()`

`separate()` \<-\> `unite()`

```{r}

# Create a toy example
df <- data.frame(
  name = c("Jae", "Sun", "Jane", NA),
  birthmonth = c("April", "April", "June", NA)
)

# Include missing values
df %>% unite(
  "contact",
  c("name", "birthmonth")
)

# Do not include missing values
df %>% unite("contact",
  c("name", "birthmonth"),
  na.rm = TRUE
)
```

## Filling

This is a relatively less-known function of the tidyr package. However, I found this function super useful to complete time-series data. For instance, how can you replace NA in the following example (this use case is drawn from the [tidyr package vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/fill.html).)?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Example
stock <- tibble::tribble(
  ~quarter, ~year, ~stock_price,
  "Q1", 2000, 10000,
  "Q2", NA, 10001, # Replace NA with 2000
  "Q3", NA, 10002, # Replace NA with 2000
  "Q4", NA, 10003, # Replace NA with 2000
  "Q1", 2001, 10004,
  "Q2", NA, 10005, # Replace NA with 2001
  "Q3", NA, 10006, # Replace NA with 2001
  "Q4", NA, 10007, # Replace NA with 2001
)

stock
```

```{r}
stock
```

Let's take a slightly more complex example. 

```{r}
# Example
yelp_rate <- tibble::tribble(
  ~neighborhood, ~restraurant_type, ~popularity_rate,
  "N1", "Chinese", 5,
  "N2", NA, 4,
  "N3", NA, 3,
  "N4", NA, 2,
  "N1", "Indian", 1,
  "N2", NA, 2,
  "N3", NA, 3,
  "N4", NA, 4,
  "N1", "Mexican", 5
)

yelp_rate
```

```{r}

fill(yelp_rate, restraurant_type) # default is direction = .down
```

```{r}
fill(yelp_rate, restraurant_type, .direction = "up")
```

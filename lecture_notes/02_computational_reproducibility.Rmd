# Computational reproducibility

## Motivation

Why do you need to make your research computationally reproducible?:

![](https://GitHub.com/dlab-berkeley/efficient-reproducible-project-management-in-R/blob/master/misc/screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Key ideas

-   Replication = code + data

-   Computational reproducibility = code + data + environment + distribution

-   Reproducibility checklist by [Roger D. Peng (biostatistics professor at Johns Hopkins)](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/)

    1.  Start with science (avoid vague questions and concepts)

    2.  Don't do things by hand (not only about automation but also documentation)

    3.  Don't point and click (same problem)

    4.  Teach a computer (automation also solves documentation to some extent)

    5.  Use some version control

    6.  Don't save output (instead, keep the input and code)

    7.  Set your seed

    8.  Think about the entire pipeline

## Organizing files

You won't be able to reproduce your project unless it is efficiently organized.

Step 1. [**Environment**](https://environments.rstudio.com/) is part of your project. If someone can't reproduce your environment, they won't be able to run your code.

-   Launch R Studio. Tools \> Global Options. You **should not** check Restore .RData into workspace at startup. Also, set the saving workspace option to **NEVER.**

Step 2. For each project, create a project directory named after the project.

name_of_the_project

-   data:
    -   raw
    -   processed (all processed, cleaned, and tided)
-   figures
-   packrat (optional)
-   reports (PDF, HTML, TEX, etc.,)
-   results (model outcomes, etc.,)
-   scripts (i.e., functions)
-   .gitignore (for Git)
-   name_of_project.Rproj (for R)
-   README.md (for Git)

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Don't name it a project. Instead, use a more informative name. For instance, `world_bank_2022`, not `my_project.`

dir.create("../world_bank_2022")
```

Step 3. Launch R Studio. Choose File \> New project \> Browse existing directories \> Create project. This allows each project has its workspace.

Step 4. Organize files by putting them in separate subdirectories and sensibly naming them.

-   Treat raw data as read-only (raw data should be RAW!) and put it in the `data` subdirectory.

**Challenge**

Set a project structure for a project named "starwars."

## Setting file paths

-   In addition to environment, **workflow** is an essential component of project efficiency and reproducibility.

-   If you care about computational reproducibility, you might be interested in using RStudio project and `here` package. The key idea is what should be treated as permanent (i.e., READ-ONLY raw data) and what should be treated as disposable (e.g., sessions, outputs).

-   First, I will demonstrate how RStudio project works and then how you should set up your RStudio global settings for workspace.

-   Second, I will explain why `here()` is a better option than using `getwd()`.

-   Below is what a typical R script looks like.

-   `setwd()`: set a working directory.

-   Note that using `setwd()` is not a reproducible way to set up your project. For instance, none will be able to run the following code except me.

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Remove objects 
rm(list = ls())

# Set a working directory 
setwd("/media/jae/backup/r-fundamentals")

dir.create("/media/jae/backup/r-fundamentals/outputs")
```

```{r}
# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point() +
   labs(x = "Miles per gallon",
        y = "Weight")

# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()

ggsave("/media/jae/backup/r-fundamentals/outputsexample.png") # This is called relative path 
```

-   Instead, learn how to use `here()`'.

    -   Key idea: separate workflow (e.g., workspace information) from products (code and data). For more information, please read Jenny Bryan's excellent piece on [project-oriented workflow](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/).
    -   Example

```{r eval = FALSE}
# Remove objects 
rm(list = ls())

# Make the current project directory as an R project

# Do something 
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt)) +
   geom_point()

# Export the object. 
# dot means the working directory set by setwd()

# The same as above 
ggsave(here::here("outputs", # depth 1 
                  "example.png")) # depth 2

here("outputs", "example.png")

here("outputs", "pngs")
```

-   How `here` works

    `here()` function shows what's the top-level project directory.

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here()

```

-   Build a path including subdirectories

```{r eval = FALSE}

here::here("project", "outputs")
           #depth 1   #depth 2
```

-   How `here` defines the top-level project directory. For example, the following list came from [the here package vignette](https://GitHub.com/jennybc/here_here)).

    -   Is a file named .here present?

    -   Is this an RStudio Project? (**Note that we already set up an RStudio Project!** So, if you use RStudio's project feature, then you are ready to use `here`.)

    -   Is this an R package? Does it have a DESCRIPTION file?

    -   Is this a remake project? Does it have a file named `remake.yml`?

    -   Is this a projectile project? Does it have a file named `.projectile`?

    -   Is this a checkout from a version control system? Does it have a directory named `.git` or `.svn`? Currently, only Git and Subversion are supported.

    -   If there's no match then use `set_here()` to create an empty `.here` file.

**Challenge**

1.  Can you define computational reproducibility?
2.  Can you explain why sharing code and data is not enough for computational reproducibility?

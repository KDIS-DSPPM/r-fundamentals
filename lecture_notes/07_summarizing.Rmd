# Setup 

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse, gapminder, nycflights13, broom)
```

# Counting

- How many countries are in each continent?

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  count(continent)
```

- Let's arrange the result.

```{r}
# Just add a new argument `sort = TRUE`
gapminder %>%
  count(continent, sort = TRUE)

# Same as above; How nice!
gapminder %>%
  count(continent) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))
```

**Challenge**

Count the number of observations per `continent` and `year` and arrange them in descending order.

Let's take a deeper look at how things work under the hood.

- `tally()` works similar to `nrow()`: Calculate the total number of cases in a dataframe

- `count` = `group_by()` + `tally()`

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  tally()
```

- `add_tally()` = `mutate(n = n())`

**Challenge**

What does **n** in the below example represent?

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  dplyr::select(continent, country) %>%
  add_tally()
```

- `add_count`

Add count as a column.

```{r}
# Add count as a column
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  add_count(year)
```

**Challenge**

Do cases 1 and 2 in the below code chunk produce the same outputs? If so, why?

```{r}
# Case 1
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent, year) %>%
  count()

# Case 2
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  count(year)
```

`count()` is a simple function, but it is still helpful to learn an essential concept underlying complex data wrangling: split-apply-combine strategy. For more information, read Wickham's article (2011) ["The Split-Apply-Combine Strategy for Data Analysis"](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.182.5667&rep=rep1&type=pdf) published in the *Journal of Statistical Software* (especially pages 7-8). [`plyr`](https://github.com/hadley/plyr) was the package (retired) that demonstrated this idea, which has evolved into two directions: [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) (for data frames) and [purrr](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) (for lists)

# Summarizing

## Basic

- Create a summary
- Think of `summarise()` as an extended version of `count()`.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdp = sd(gdpPercap)
  )

tablea <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    sd_gdp = sd(gdpPercap)
  )
```

- Produce publishable tables

```{r}
pacman::p_load(
  kableExtra,
  flextable
)

# For HTML and LaTeX
tablea %>% kableExtra::kable()

# For HTML and MS Office suite
tablea %>% flextable::flextable()
```

## Scoped summaries

-   Old way
-   `summarise_all()`

```{r}
# Create a wide-shaped data example
wide_gapminder <- gapminder %>%
  dplyr::filter(continent == "Europe") %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = country,
    values_from = gdpPercap
  )

# Apply summarise_all
wide_gapminder %>%
  dplyr::select(-c(1:4)) %>%
  summarise_all(mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- `summarise_if()`: using a logical condition

```{r}
wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_if(is.double, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

- `summarise_at()`

- `vars() = select()`

```{r}
wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_at(vars(-c(1:4)),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise_at(vars(contains("life")),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  )
```

**Additional tips**

![Concept map for regular expressions. By Monica Alonso, Greg Wilson.](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/raw/master/en/regular-expressions.svg)

- New way

- `summarise()` + `across()`

![Concept map for across. By Emma Vestesson](https://github.com/rstudio/concept-maps/raw/master/en/across.svg)

- If you find using `summarise_all()`, `summarise_if()` and `summarise_at()` confusing, here's a solution: use `summarise()` with `across()`.

- `summarise_all()`

```{r}
wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(Albania:`United Kingdom`, mean, na.rm = TRUE))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(-c(1:4), mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- `summarise_if()`

```{r}
wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(is.double, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- `summarise_at()`

```{r}
wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(-c(1:4),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(contains("life"),
    mean,
    na.rm = TRUE
  ))

wide_gapminder %>%
  summarise(across(contains("A", ignore.case = FALSE)))
```

Note that this workshop does not cover creating and manipulating variables using `mutate()` because many techniques you learned from playing with `summarise()` can be directly applied to `mutate()`.

**Challenge**

1. Summarize the average GDP of countries whose names start with the alphabet "A."

2. Turn the summary dataframe into a publishable table using either `kableExtra` or `flextable` package.

**Additional tips**

```{r}
gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    do(tidy(lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = .)))

gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    do(tidy(lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = .), conf.int = T))

gapminder %>%
    group_by(continent) %>%
    do(tidy(lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = .), conf.int = T)) %>%
    filter(term == "gdpPercap") %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(continent, estimate),  y = estimate, 
               ymax = conf.high, 
               ymin = conf.low)) +
    geom_pointrange() +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = "Continent", y = "Estimate")
```

# Grouping

## Grouped summaries

- Calculate the mean of `gdpPercap`.

- Some functions are designed to work together. For instance, the 	`group_by()` function defines the strata you will use for summary statistics. Then, use `summarise()` to obtain summary statistics.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap))
```

-   Calculate multiple summary statistics.

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(
    mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap),
    count = n()
  )
```

**Optional**

-   Other summary statistics

1.  Measures of spread: `median(x)`, `sd(x)`, `IQR(x)`, `mad(x)` (the median absolute deviation)

```{r}
# The Interquartile Range = The Difference Between 75t and 25t Percentiles

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(IQR_gdp = IQR(gdpPercap))
```

2.  Measures of rank: `min(x)`, `quantile(x, 0.25)`, `max(x)`

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% #
  summarise(
    min_gdp = min(gdpPercap),
    max_gdp = max(gdpPercap)
  )
```

3.  Measures of position: `first(x)`, `last(x)`, `nth(x, 2)`

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(
    first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
    last_gdp = last(gdpPercap)
  )

gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  arrange(gdpPercap) %>% # Adding arrange
  summarise(
    first_gdp = first(gdpPercap),
    last_gdp = last(gdpPercap)
  )
```

4.  Measures of counts: `n(x)` (all rows), `sum(!is.na(x))` (only non-missing rows) = `n_distinct(x)`

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(ns = n())
```

5.  Counts and proportions of logical values: `sum(condition about x)` (the number of TRUEs in x), `mean(condition about x)` (the proportion of TRUEs in x)

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarise(rich_countries = mean(gdpPercap > 20000))
```

**Additional tips**

Also, check out window functions such as `cumsum()` and `lag()`. Window functions are a variant of aggregate functions that take a vector as input then return a vector of the same length as an output. 

```{r}
vec <- c(1:10)

# Typical aggregate function
sum(vec) # The output length is one

# Window function
cumsum(vec) # The output length is ten
```

# Joining

Relational data = multiple tables of data

![Relational data example](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/245292d1ea724f6c3fd8a92063dcd7bfb9758d02/5751b/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

**Key ideas**

- A **primary key** "uniquely identifies an observation in its table"

```{r}
# Example
planes$tailnum %>% head()
```

Verify primary key

`tailnum` should be unique. 

**Challenge**

What do you expect the outcome?

```{r}
planes %>%
  count(tailnum) %>%
  dplyr::filter(n > 1)
```

**Optional**

If a dataframe doesn't have a primary key, you can add one called a **surrogate** key.

```{r}
# Toy example
df <- tibble(
  x = c(1:3),
  y = c(4:6)
)

# Add a row_index column
df <- df %>% rowid_to_column("ID")
```

- A **foreign** key "uniquely identifies an observation in another table."

```{r}
flights$tailnum %>% head()
```

For joining, don't be distracted by other details and focus on KEYS!

## Mutating joins

> Add new variables to one data frame from matching observations in another"

Using a simple toy example is great because it is easy to see how things work in that much narrow context.

-   Toy example

```{r}
# Table 1
x <- tibble(
  key = c(1:4),
  val_x = c("x1", "x2", "x3", "x4")
)

# Table 2
y <- tibble(
  key = c(1:5),
  val_y = c("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4", "y5")
)
```

-   Inner Join

`inner_join()` keeps the matched values in both tables. If the left table is a subset of the right table, then `left_join()` is the same as `inner_join()`.

**Challenge**

What is going to be the shared keys?

```{r}
inner_join(x, y)
```

![Mutating joins](https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/aeab386461820b029b7e7606ccff1286f623bae1/ef0d4/diagrams/join-venn.png)

-   Left Join

`left_join()`, `right_join()` and `full_join()` are outer join functions. Unlike `inner_join()`, outer join functions keep observations that appear in at least one of the tables.

`left_join()` keeps only the matched observations in the right table.

```{r}
left_join(x, y)
```

-   Right Join

`right_join()` does the opposite. 

```{r}
right_join(x, y)
```

-   Full Join

`full_join()` keeps the observations from both tables. NAs were recorded in one of the two tables if they were unmatched.

```{r}
full_join(x, y)
```

## Filtering joins

> Filter observations from one data frame based on whether they match an observation in the other table.

-   Semi Join

In SQL, this type of query is also called subqueries.

-   Filtering without joining

```{r}
# Create the list of the top 10 destinations
top_dest <- flights %>%
  count(dest, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

# Filter
filtered <- flights %>%
  dplyr::filter(dest %in% top_dest$dest)
```

-   Using semi join: only keep (INCLUDE) the rows that were matched between the two tables

```{r}
joined <- flights %>%
  semi_join(top_dest)

head(filtered == joined)
```

-   Anti Join

`anti_join()` does the opposite. Exclude the rows that were matched between the two tables. A great technique to filter stopwords when you do computational text analysis.

```{r}
flights %>%
  anti_join(planes, by = "tailnum") %>%
  count(tailnum, sort = TRUE)
```
